  ### Not working as expected and need help?

If you need technical assistance and more information on a product that is not working as you expected, we recommend heading on over to the [SparkFun Technical Assistance](https://www.sparkfun.com/technical_assistance) page for some initial troubleshooting.

If you don't find what you need there, the [SparkFun Forums](https://community.sparkfun.com/)  are a great place to find and ask for help. If this is your first visit, you'll need to create a forum account to search product forums and post questions.
